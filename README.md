## Overview.

I worked with the React framework to create a Movies app, which was expanded upon from my lab work.

### Features.

+ List of Upcoming movies.
+ List of Popular movies.
+ List of Top Rated movies.
+ List of Actor's movies.
+ Movie Favourites page.
+ Movie Details page.
## Setup requirements.
[ Outline any non-standard setup steps necessary to run your app locally after cloning the repo.]
Use npm install.

## API endpoints.

[ List the __additional__ TMDB endpoints used, giving the description and pathname for each one.] 


+ /movie/upcoming - Upcoming movies.
+ /movie/top_rated - Top rated movies.
+ /movie/popular - Popular movies.
+ /actors - Actors home page with names.

.

## Routing.

After favouriting a movie, we can then see all displayed favourites in this page.
